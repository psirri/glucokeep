TODO CURRENT:

- make icon
- move Exercise and Carbs checkboxes to right

------------------------------------------------

- reorganize code
- use interpolated data for IQR calculations

------------------------------------------------

0.5 HOUR
    - make the last window(s)

------------------------------------------------

0.25 HOUR
    - link UI buttons together

ONE HOUR
    - read data from a csv file into numpy
    - write data to file
        - time
        - type of event
        - value
        - value 2 (blank unless exercise)

3.5 hours: implement data visualization methods
        - setup figure canvas (0.50 HOUR)
        - support for date range (.50 HOUR)
        - trends plot (0.75 HOUR)
            - IQR with modular ranges
            - scatter plot with up to 7 days
            - linear interpolation (inactive box until scatter plot is active)
            - toggle each type of event
        - tab for time in range as pie chart and bar graph (0.50 HOUR)
        - tab for all other scores (0.50 HOUR)
        - hover feature? maybe once the paper is more finalized (0.75)


0.5 hours
    - make app icon

0.5 hours
    - set icon as app background on start screen





Is this worth my time?
make the visualize button work for any file type
make save event only work for when



# later: exercise events are causing "ragged nested warning" bc of length

change to object oriented event lists
